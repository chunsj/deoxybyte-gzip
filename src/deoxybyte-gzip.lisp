- dest (vector): An octet vector.

Key:

- compression (fixnum): The Zlib compression factor (0-9, inclusive).
- suppress-header (boolean): Exposes an undocumented feature of Zlib
  whereby the compressed data may be produced without a Zlib header or
  checksum.
- gzip-format (boolean): write the gzip format instead of the Zlib format.
- window-bits (fixnum): The Zlib window-bits argument (9-15, inclusive).
- mem-level (fixnum): The Zlib mem-level argument (1-9, inclusive).
- strategy (fixnum): The Zlib strategy argument (one
  of :default-strategy , :filtered or :huffman-only ).

Returns:
- The DEST vector, containing compressed data.
- Number of bytes read.
- Number of bytes written (consequently the end position of the
  compressed data in DEST)."

Arguments:

- operation (symbol): The operation type, either :inflate or :deflate .
- source (stream): A Lisp octet input stream.
- dest (stream): A Lisp octet output stream.
- input-fn (function): A Lisp function that accepts 3 arguments, an
  input stream, a buffer and an integer n. The function must read up
  to n bytes from the input stream into the buffer and return the
  number of bytes read.
- output-fn (function): A Lisp function that accepts 3 arguments, an
  output stream, a buffer and an integer n. The function must write up
  to n bytes to the output stream into the buffer and return the
  number of bytes written.
- buffer-size (fixnum): The size of the buffer used in the
